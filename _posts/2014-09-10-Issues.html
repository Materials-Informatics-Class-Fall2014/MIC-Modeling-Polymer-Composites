Building Structure-Property Relationships
Experimental Pathway
	Where from the structures are coming?
We are considering samples of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymers. We do micro-CT on each of those samples. Micro-CT gives us 92 images for the various layers of a particular sample.
Issues
•	What do we do with those layer by layer images?
•	A 3D-microstructural model can be built using those 92 images by stacking them one on top of the other. How to combine the images of various layers of a sample to build a 3D microstructural model? Is 3D microstructural model required? Are those 2D layer by layer micro-CT images of any use?
•	What are the 3D-microstructure model pre-processing techniques and processing techniques to obtain data?
•	How to obtain the microstructure function?

	Where from the property data is coming? – 
Issues
•	We can carry out Nano-indentation.
•	Data can also be related to tensile testing of the samples sent for micro-CT. Is this doable?

	How to develop microstructure-property linkage? 
Simulation Pathway
Issues 
	Do we simulate 3D microstructural model? Or Do we simulate micro-structure function?
	How do we carry out Finite Element Analysis and what is it going to give us? Is it going to give us any data related to property?
