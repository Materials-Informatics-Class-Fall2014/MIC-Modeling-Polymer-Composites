## Experimental Pathway

1) Where from the structures are coming?

We are considering samples of Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymers. We do micro-CT on each of those samples. Micro-CT gives us 92 images for the various layers of a particular sample.

•	What do we do with those layer by layer images?
•	A 3D-microstructural model can be built using those 92 images by stacking them one on top of the other. How to combine the images of various layers of a sample to build a 3D microstructural model? Is 3D microstructural model required? Are those 2D layer by layer micro-CT images of any use?
•	What are the 3D-microstructure model pre-processing techniques and processing techniques to obtain data?
•	How to obtain the microstructure function?

2) Where from the property data is coming? 

•	We can carry out Nano-indentation.
•	Data can also be related to tensile testing of the samples sent for micro-CT. Is this doable?

3) How to develop microstructure-property linkage? 

## Simulation Pathway

• Do we simulate 3D microstructural model? Or Do we simulate micro-structure function?
• How do we carry out Finite Element Analysis and what is it going to give us? Is it going to give us any data related to property?
