# Developing Structure-Property Linkage for Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites

## Background and Motivation
Elaborate Slide # 2, 3 and 4

## Project Outline
Considering GFRP composites' tremendous applications and inability of theoretical models to accurately predict the properties, we
propose to establish a structure-property linkage. In oder to achieve this objective, we follow the steps as shown in 
following figure.

### GFRP Sample Collection
Please discuss about slide #6

### Micro-CT
After the samples are manufactured, Micro-CT is performed to get the cross-sections of the samples. Cross-sections help in creating
a 3D-model. Few of the example cross-sections can be seen [here](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/10/Visualizing-Data.html).
Please add rest of the details from slide #6.

### Data Visualization
Visualization is an integral part of data analysis. Details of data visualization can be found in the following posts: 
[Post 1](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/17/Presentation1.html), [Post 2](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/29/Sample-Analytics.html),
[Post 3](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/09/Sample-Analytics-N.html).

### Image Segmentation
For digital representation of the material structure, it is required to segment the two phases in our samples. In colloboration
with Dr. Tony Fast, we developed a image segmentation algorithm known as "[Multimodal Data Segmentation using Peak Fitting
Algorithm and Gaussian Likelihood Maximization](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/15/Segmentation-via-Gaussian-Likelihood-Approximation.html)".

### Microstructure and Physical Property Simulation
To establish a structure-property linakge, we require a rich dataset consisting of varied microstructures and their corresponding
properties. Due to lack of enough number of real samples, we go for simulating a variety of microstructures as shown in following figure.

(Please elaborate) Finite element method is used to calculate the property.
