# Developing Structure-Property Linkage for Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites

## Background and Motivation
Elaborate Slide # 2, 3 and 4

## Project Outline
Considering GFRP composites' tremendous applications and inability of theoretical models to accurately predict the properties, we
propose to establish a structure-property linkage. In oder to achieve this objective, we follow the steps as shown in 
following figure.

### GFRP Sample Collection
Please discuss about slide #6

### Micro-CT and DICOM Data
After the samples are manufactured, Micro-CT is performed to get the cross-sections of the samples. Cross-sections help in creating
a 3D-model. Few of the example cross-sections can be seen [here](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/10/Visualizing-Data.html).
Please add rest of the details from slide #6.

### Data Visualization and Analytics
Visualization and analytics are the integral part of data analysis. Details of data visualization and analytics can be found in the following posts: 
[Post 1](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/17/Presentation1.html), [Post 2](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/29/Sample-Analytics.html),
[Post 3](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/09/Sample-Analytics-N.html).

### Image Segmentation
For digital representation of the material structure, it is required to segment the two phases in our samples. In colloboration
with [Dr. Tony Fast](https://github.com/tonyfast), we developed a image segmentation algorithm known as "[Multimodal Data Segmentation using Peak Fitting
Algorithm and Gaussian Likelihood Maximization](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/15/Segmentation-via-Gaussian-Likelihood-Approximation.html)" to
segment the highly complex and uncertain fibrous microstructures.

### Microstructure and Physical Property Simulation
To establish a structure-property linakge, we require a rich dataset consisting of varied microstructures and their corresponding
properties. Due to lack of enough number of real samples, we go for simulating a variety of microstructures as shown in following figure.
To do this task, we extensively colloborated with our Materials Informatics class mate [Dipen Patel](https://github.com/Materials-Informatics-Lab).

(Please elaborate) Finite element method is used to calculate the property.

### Spatial Statistics
In order to quantify spatial correlations in the microstructures, we employ 2-point statistics that informs "probability density 
associated with finding local states h and h' at the tail and head of a prescribed vector r randomly placed into the microstructure"
(Kalidindi, 2014). Details about the 2-point statistics on real samples can be found in the following posts: [Post 1](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/24/Spatial_Statistics.html),
[Post 2](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/28/Normalized_Spacial_Stats.html), [Post 3](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/10/29/Presentation.html).

### Dimensionality Reduction
2-point statistics of each of the microstructures are a high-dimensional data. We use classic statistical technique known as principal
components analysis to obtain a low-dimension representation of this spatial correlations.

### Structure Property Linkage
[Regression model](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34918-multivariate-polynomial-regression) is developed to establish the linkage. Reduced order representation of spatial correlations (2-Point Statistics)
and property obtained from FEM for the microstructures are the inputs and ouput respectively for the regression model.

### Closure
1) Carried out analysis of real microstructures: Visualization, Analytics, Segmentation, 2-Point Statistics

2) Simulated microstructures and property data to build a dataset required for linkage development

3) Calculated 2-Point Statistics for simulated microstructures and then performed Principal Components Analysis

4) Developed Regression Model for structure-property linkage

### Collaboration

1) Dr. Tony Fast: Data Visualization and Analytics, Segmentation and 2-Point Statistics

2) Dipen Patel: Microstructure Simulation and Finite Element Analysis

### Challenges and Scope for Future Work
1) Need to obtain some more real microstructures.

2) Carry out physical experimental testing on those real samples to get real property data

3) Measure fibre metrics like length, width, curvature etc.

4) Incorporate aformentioned fibre metrics while simulating some more variety of microstructures

5) Perform FEM analysis on those simulated microstructures

6) Once the tasks 1-5 are completed, it would be easier to go from there. Spatial Staistics, PCA and Regression Modelling 
would be the next steps.
