## Micro-CT images

Here are a few initial Micro-CT images.  These images come from the S block which is located at the injection location. 
Differences in the density between the fiber and the matrix result in the image.  Light pixels are fibers and dark pixels are the matrix.  
The original images from the Micro-CT are in a [Dicom](http://dicom.nema.org/) format. Dicom images are available to download from dropbox [here]({{dropbox}}).
