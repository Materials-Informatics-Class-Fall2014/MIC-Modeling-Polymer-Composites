### Voigt model 

The Voigt model is as simple relationship between the moduli of the components and the effective modulus of the composite. (Briefly described in Reference 1)

E = E1*v1 +E2*v2

This is a simple mixing rule for an iso-strain state.  This model assumes that the reinforcement is aligned in a single direction
and that each component experiences the same strain.
