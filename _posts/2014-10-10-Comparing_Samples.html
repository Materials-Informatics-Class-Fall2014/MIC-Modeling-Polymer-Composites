## Explination of two samples

Our data set consists of Micro-CT data from two samples taken out of a larger plate which was extrusion/compression molded.  An explination 
of the process used to create these plates can be found [here](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/19/Processing_Conditions.html).
The sample labeled S is taken from the area near where the material is extruded into the mold.  The sample labeled N is taken from farther
away in the direction of flow.
