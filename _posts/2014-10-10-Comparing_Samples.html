## Explanation of two samples

Our data set consists of Micro-CT data from two samples taken out of a larger plate which was extrusion/compression molded.  An explanation 
of the process used to create these plates can be found [here](http://awhite40.github.io/MIC-Modeling-Polymer-Composites/2014/09/19/Processing_Conditions.html).
The sample labeled S is taken from the area near where the material is extruded into the mold.  The sample labeled N is taken from farther
away in the direction of flow.

There are distictive differences between these two images.  Most notably the N sample slice visualized here shows straighter fibers in this plane.  This 
observation is consistant with an understanding of the processing conditions.  The N sample is taken from a section at a distance
from the insertion of the material into the mold.  When the mold was filled, the flow of the material caused the 
the fibers to straighten.  The result is evident in this slice of the sample.  In contrast, the S sample was taken from  the area where 
the material was inserted.  Here the flow of the material would cause bending and folding of the fibers.  This phenomenon is observed in the 
short fiber sections seen in the S slice.
