title: "Thresholding"

In progress

To extract the data from our images, it is first necessary to separate the image into the fiber and the matrix components.  In order
accomplish this we used a simple form of image segmentation known as Thresholding.  Thresholding takes all of the pixels in an image
that are lower than a certain threshold and assigns them to the lowest value of the pixels and all the pixels above the threshold value are
assigned the maximum value.  If this process is done for a range of threshold values, a graph can be created from volume fraction vs. threshold
value.  If the volume fraction of the two constituents is known the optimal thresholding value can simply be determined from this graph.  

Combining layers to form a 3D matrix adds complexity to the problem.  The value of thresholding will now depend on volume fractions in three
dimensions as well as requiring the need to loop through the various 2D slices.  The various graphs can be plotted together to show the variation
in the variation across three dimesions.  The following plots show these graphs for the X-Y plane, the Y-Z plane and the X-Z plane.
