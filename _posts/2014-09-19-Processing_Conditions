## Materials

Fiber reinforced composites are composed of 2 componenent: the matrix and the fiber.  Our sample matrix is composed of polypropylene melt.  The density of the polypropylene in these samples is  9.4 g/cm3.  General properties for polypropylene can be found [here](http://www.matweb.com/search/datasheet.aspx?MatGUID=a882a1c603374e278d062f106dfda95b).
The fiber component is glass fiber with a density of 2.54 g/cm3.  

## Processing
Creation of the fiber reienforced composite samples consists of two steps: hot melt impregnation and extrusion/compression molding.

### Hot melt impregnation
Hot melt impregnation is a processing method used with thermoplastic materials to adequately wet the reinforcement with the matrix polymer.
Adequate wetting is important to final product properties because it ensures the bond between the fiber and the matrix. 
In hot melt imprgnation, fiber is pulled from a roll and heated above the melting temperature of the chosen polymer.  
For the polypropylene used to make these samples processing temperatures would be in excess of 174 degrees Celcius.  Then the
