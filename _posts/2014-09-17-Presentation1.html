### Visualization


### Thresholding

[Thresholding](http://www.mathworks.com/discovery/image-thresholding.html) was done to separate the pixels representing the fibers from the pixels representing the matrix. 
To determine the value for thresholding the image, a threshold scan was done in each of the three planar directions (figure below). 
![thresholding graph](https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3862/15269083822_d6bb0c2210_o.jpg)

From this figure we can choose a thresholding value to apply to the images.

Code can be found at this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/awhite40/fa1178364ae06c8b1658).

## Problems

* Determine optimal boundaries for cropping to keep maximum possible experimental data
* Metric for determining if the thresholding is "good'

## Next Steps

* Choose the number of states (h)
* Create a microstructure function
* Determine spacial statistics on sample
